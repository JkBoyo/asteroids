# Asteroids by JkBoyo

This is my rendition of the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) [Asteroids Project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids).

I have yet to make any modifications from how it is left in the course but plan on coming back to differentiate/finish the project.

# Installing the needed Dependencies

The dependencies should be fairly easy to install. You will need to have Python 3.10+ installed on your machine. 

If you already have this installed follow the steps below;

1. creating a new folder on your machine to download the repo to.
2. opening your terminal of choice and changing to the file or directory you created
3. Setting up a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv` then running `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Once inside this venv run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Finally to start the game run `python3 main.py` and enjoy!
